After each Phase 1 compaction, run privacy-safe whole-history sessions --all (and daily/report --all when the peak changes) on the maintainer corpus. Record peak RSS, wall time, UROLLUP_STATS row counts and worker-count identity. Quote no paths, IDs or prompt text. Update the scalable-ingestion spec Progress table and the 512 MiB checkbox when the goal is met.

Acceptance: dated privacy-safe numbers in the spec; uro-n1cp closable only when peak is at or below 512 MiB and make check is green.

## Notes

2026-09-19: After uro-mxcp, loaded sessions --all: exit 0, 796 MiB (815008 KiB), 81.3 s at load 117–193, workers=8, same row counts as uro-ecol. Quiet-machine 804 MiB / 22.1 s after l3fw revert is the last low-load baseline. Still above 512 MiB. Next cut uro-h0fw.

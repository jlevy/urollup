After each Phase 1 compaction, run privacy-safe whole-history sessions --all (and daily/report --all when the peak changes) on the maintainer corpus. Record peak RSS, wall time, UROLLUP_STATS row counts and worker-count identity. Quote no paths, IDs or prompt text. Update the scalable-ingestion spec Progress table and the 512 MiB checkbox when the goal is met.

Acceptance: dated privacy-safe numbers in the spec; uro-n1cp closable only when peak is at or below 512 MiB and make check is green.

## Notes

2026-09-19: last closed cut uro-24ua. Paired A/B: Codex-only 614 MiB (628608 KiB) / 14.5 s, WH 768 MiB (786656 KiB) / 17.5 s. uro-7w0u was 645/770. uro-3y9m remasure was 659/786. Gate still 512 MiB. Next uro-o5c0.
